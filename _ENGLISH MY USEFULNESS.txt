üéØ What DXVK Async Will Bring You:

‚úÖ 1. Massive Smoothness Boost (Huge Stutter Reduction)

Skyrim SE is a DirectX 11 game, but it wasn‚Äôt designed to dynamically manage shader compilation like modern engines do.

When using DXVK Async:
Shaders are compiled asynchronously ‚Üí no more freezing during compilation.
Result: You can explore modded areas (Solitude, Falkreath Forest, etc.) without stuttering.

‚úÖ This is the most immediately noticeable benefit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

‚úÖ 2. Huge Improvement in 1% and 0.1% Low FPS

1% and 0.1% Low FPS are indicators of micro-freezes or stutters.

With DXVK Async, you might see something like this:
Before: Avg: 60 FPS / 1% Low: 17 FPS / 0.1% Low: 6 FPS
After : Avg: 60 FPS / 1% Low: 43 FPS / 0.1% Low: 31 FPS

‚úÖ So you lose far fewer frames during transitions, entering cities, or when new NPCs appear.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

‚úÖ 3. Better Overall Stability with Heavy Modpacks

DXVK has better video memory management than Skyrim SE‚Äôs native D3D11:
You get smarter memory allocation.
You avoid some random crashes caused by stacked effects (ENB, SSAO, DoF, LUT, weathers...).

‚úÖ Result: Fewer crashes in complex areas or during long play sessions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

‚úÖ 4. Slightly Faster Loading Times

Especially for cell transitions with heavy shaders (interior ‚Üí exterior), DXVK Async reduces:
- Micro-loads when opening doors.
- Entry times into modded cities like Windhelm or Whiterun.

It‚Äôs not magic, but you gain a few seconds and experience fewer hitches.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

‚úÖ 5. DXVK Handles VRAM Much Better Than Native DirectX 11

Skyrim SE under DirectX 11 handles VRAM rigidly and not very efficiently.
DXVK, even in its Async version, converts D3D11 calls to Vulkan, which allows:

- Better recycling of GPU memory.
- More flexible management of shader caches, textures, and buffers.
- Fewer passive memory leaks from heavy effects (e.g., SSAO, DoF, dynamic weather).

‚úÖ Result: Skyrim SE becomes more tolerant of high VRAM usage, meaning fewer crashes when playing for long periods or frequently transitioning between interior/exterior zones.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

‚ö†Ô∏è What DXVK Async Does Not Improve Directly:

- Your pure average framerate (AVG FPS) won‚Äôt radically increase.
- You won‚Äôt "magically gain 20 FPS", but the game will feel twice as smooth because stutters are smoothed out.
- Script or mod bugs ‚Üí DXVK does not affect the Papyrus engine or scripts.
